3. Check confidence scores and responses

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ High-confidence queries get detailed responses
- ✅ Low-confidence queries get appropriate warnings
- ✅ Confidence scores are reasonable (0.0-1.0)

### 3. Performance Testing

#### 3.1 Response Time Testing
**Objective**: Monitor response times under various conditions

**Steps**:
1. Time responses for different query types:
   - Simple questions
   - Complex questions
   - Thread generation
2. Note processing times
3. Check for consistency

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Response times are reasonable (< 30 seconds)
- ✅ Processing times are displayed accurately
- ✅ Performance is consistent

#### 3.2 Concurrent User Testing
**Objective**: Test system under concurrent load

**Steps**:
1. Open multiple browser tabs/windows
2. Send simultaneous requests
3. Monitor system behavior
4. Check for errors or degradation

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ System handles concurrent requests
- ✅ No data corruption
- ✅ Graceful degradation under load

### 4. Metadata and Analytics Testing

#### 4.1 Source Citations Test
**Objective**: Verify source citations are working

**Steps**:
1. Ask questions that should reference specific documents
2. Check if sources are properly cited
3. Verify source information is accurate

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Sources are listed for responses
- ✅ Source information is accurate
- ✅ Citations are properly formatted

#### 4.2 Analytics Dashboard Test
**Objective**: Test analytics functionality

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/analytics`
2. Check analytics data
3. Verify query history is tracked

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Analytics page loads
- ✅ Query history is displayed
- ✅ Usage statistics are accurate

#### 4.3 Database Verification
**Objective**: Verify metadata database functionality

**Steps**:
1. Check if `rag_metadata.db` file exists
2. Use SQLite browser or command line to inspect tables
3. Verify data is being logged correctly

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Database file exists
- ✅ Tables are created correctly
- ✅ Data is being logged

### 5. Error Handling Testing

#### 5.1 Invalid Input Testing
**Objective**: Test system response to invalid inputs

**Steps**:
1. Try empty questions
2. Try very long questions
3. Try special characters
4. Try malformed JSON

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Invalid inputs are handled gracefully
- ✅ Appropriate error messages are shown
- ✅ System doesn't crash

#### 5.2 Network Error Testing
**Objective**: Test system behavior during network issues

**Steps**:
1. Temporarily disconnect from internet
2. Try making requests
3. Check error handling

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Network errors are handled gracefully
- ✅ Appropriate error messages are shown
- ✅ System remains stable

### 6. Integration Testing

#### 6.1 End-to-End Workflow Test
**Objective**: Test complete user workflow

**Steps**:
1. Start with a complex question
2. Follow up with related questions
3. Generate a thread on the topic
4. Check analytics
